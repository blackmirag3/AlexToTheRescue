## Project Description
We built a robot with search and rescue capabilities, applying baremetal coding concepts in our Arduino code as well

Robot has the following functions:  
- Tele-operated using VNC via WIFI
- Powered by RPi and Arduino Uno with UART implementation
- Ability to map vicinity using LIDAR module
- Forward facing colour sensor to identify "identity" of detected victims in simulated test environment
